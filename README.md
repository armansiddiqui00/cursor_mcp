## Usage Examples

### Code Completion
```python
# Start typing a function and Cursor completes it for you
def calculate_average(numbers):
    # Cursor suggests: 
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```

### Code Generation
```
# Type a comment describing what you need
# Create a function that validates email addresses
# Cursor generates the complete implementation
```

### Debugging Assistant
```
# When facing an error, ask Cursor:
